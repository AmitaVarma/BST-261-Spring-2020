    "You will be performing one iteration of the forward pass and backpropagation calculations for a small network using Python. Here we will focus on the calculations for one training example, though in reality your data sets will be much larger and require matrix computation. You will also calculate the associated loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X_1 = 2$ and $X_2 = -1$ be the feature inputs and initialize the weights to be as shown in the figure below. This is a neural network with a single hidden layer consisting of three nodes. The blue numbers within each node represent the values for the bias terms and the black numbers along the edges represent the weights. The hidden layer outputs a single node, from which your task is binary classification. The label for this particular training example outcome is $y = 1$. \n",

    "### Question 2\n",
    "In class we were considering classification problems where the goal was to predict a single discrete label of an input data point. Another common type of machine learning problem is \"regression\", which consists of predicting a continuous value instead of a discrete label. For instance, predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data, or predicting the time that a software project will take to complete, given its specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be attempting to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be using has another interesting difference from our previous examples: it has very few data points, only 506 in total, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples, and each \"feature\" in the input data (e.g. the crime rate is a feature) has a different scale. For instance some values are proportions, which take a values between 0 and 1, others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists 13 features. The 13 features in the input data are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Per capita crime rate.\n",
    "2. Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.\n",
    "3. Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
    "4. Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).\n",
    "5. Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).\n",
    "6. Average number of rooms per dwelling.\n",
    "7. Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.\n",
    "8. Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.\n",
    "9. Index of accessibility to radial highways.\n",
    "10. Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.\n",
    "11. Pupil-teacher ratio by town.\n",
    "12. 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town.\n",
    "13. % lower SES status of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets (outcomes, y) are the median values of owner-occupied homes, in thousands of dollars. The prices are typically between 10,000 and 50,000 dollars. If that sounds cheap, remember this was the mid-1970s, and these prices are not inflation-adjusted."

    "It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), we will subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature will be centered around 0 and will have a unit standard deviation.\n",
